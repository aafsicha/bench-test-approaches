# bench-test-approaches
The idea is to setup some benchmarks on different tests suites
- Specflow on the API (with http layer)
- NUnit on the API (with http layer)
- Specflow on the API (on the controller)
- NUnit on the API (on the controller)

After all of that, we'll see on which kind of test we'll be able to focus to have a quick feedback (ie usable with ncrunch)
